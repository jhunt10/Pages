**main**
XXX Minimize clicks: Select target creature, select map(?)
Larger turn log, maybe shorter text?
I want a heal over time passive! What superclass is that?
Placing actors at start
Makes buffs small icons below health maybe?
XXX Make a "target until death" or something
XXX Highlight whoever is making the attack



Pages Notes:
XXX Lot of tutorial pages, the ammo gets a little confusing, maybe condense?
XXX Is Bchance explained?
Hover over items to see what they are?
Hover over enemies to see stats?
XXX "Select target creature" by first click, no confirm
XXX Options for larger round output log (see dominions)
XXX Some sort of feedback for using the block action, maybe hold shield the whole round? Or a little "+5 def" above actor
Maybe keyboard controls? 
XXX Is records/files for in game lore? Maybe unlock the lore as player encounters enemies
"Second to second gameplay"
XXX Middle mouse to move map?
XXX Free camera look while in move?
XXX Maybe some class specific stats on the stat screen? Like number of blessings for the priest
Ability to select a "no action", or start a round without full pages. (I see now that fill can accomplish this, but maybe just a "skip" action if you click the page slot)
XXX Maybe a "move from here to here" option that auto-fills pages for a few rounds. Just for long, multi-turn movements
XXX Maybe a "select no target" option. For some reason my light-touch attacks are healing a mushroom?
XXX Is "evasion" shown in the actor records?
XXX Mushroom record pages
XXX Some words have hover text explainers, but not consistent? (slime resistant?)
XXX "Main menu" reverted my progress when restarting a match


**Bugs**
XXX Priest light-touch can target allies
XXX Opening stats page in setup made actors invisible.
XXX All pages selected, for some reason it showed me "next", and then switched to a character will all full pages and no "start" button
XXX Knight always acts first, even with lowest speed
XXX "next" button just chooses the next actor in a cycle, even if they have all pages selected. Then there is no "next" to the actor that is actually missing pages
XXX Selecting "actor 2" in records crashes

**Actor setup screen**
Re order pages by picking them up
Rogue doesn't have many pages to use, is it a shared page book?
Maybe add hover text to show ammo calc.

**passives**
XXX Click off passive card to leave it, not just pressing the x
Lot of the passives have spelling mistakes, I can do a pass if need be
Text issues: Unstoppable, Heavy Armored
XXX Passives are "equipt", maybe just equip?

**actives**
Pommel text

**Spelling**
when rogue join the party: "rogue has `join` the party"
Mage record
Priest record


**Crash**
XXX Lvl 3, fighting in cave: Invalid operands 'Nil' and 'String' in operator '+'.
Main_scene, line 20, maybe execute_action_motion_animation
